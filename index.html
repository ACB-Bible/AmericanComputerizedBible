            <b>The "American Computerized Bible"</b> is a ministry the Lord has laid on my heart and it's a work in
            progress and will contain many different public domain versions of the Bible. The "Twenty First Century
            Bible" is just one part of this ministry and I'm translating it from various ancient texts and "The King James
            Version" of the Bible which was first published in 1611. The "Twenty First Century Bible" is a living Biblical
            translation and it's inspired by the teachings of Jesus for people in the twenty-first century and beyond to
            study. As of February 25, 2023, except for editing and proof reading, translation through the book of Leviticus Chapter:
            11, is mostly complete until tomorrow.</p>
