                beginning, God created Heaven and Earth.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">2</span>The Earth was void and without form, darkness covered the face of the
                deep, and God's Spirit moved over the waters.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">3</span>And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">4</span>God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the
                darkness.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">5</span>God called the light Day and the darkness Night, and that morning and
                that evening were the first day.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">6</span>And God said, "Let there be a firmament in the middle of the waters,
                and it'll divide the waters from the waters."
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">7</span>Then God made the firmament and divided the waters under the
                firmament from the waters above the firmament, and it was so.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">8</span>God called the firmament Heaven, and that morning and that evening
                were the second day.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">9</span>And God said, "Let the waters under Heaven be gathered together into
                one place and let the dry land appear," and it was so.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">10</span>Then God named the dry land Earth and He called the waters the seas,
                and God saw that it was good.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">11</span>And God said, "Let the Earth bring forth every kind of seed bearing
                plant, including grass, herbs, and fruit trees, each with their own kind of seed," and it was so.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">12</span>And the Earth brought forth all the seed bearing plants, including
                every kind of grass, herb, and fruit tree that there was, and God saw that it was good.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">13</span>And that morning and that evening were the third day.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">14</span>And God said, "Let there be lights in the Heavens to divide the day
                from the night and let them be a sign for the seasons, to seperate the days, months, and years.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">15</span>Let the lights in the Heavens give light on the Earth," and it was
                so.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">16</span>Then God made two great lights, the Sun to rule the day, and the
                Moon and Stars to rule the night.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">17</span>God placed the lights in the Heavens to give light to the Earth.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">18</span>And to divide the light from the darkness, and rule over the days
                and nights, and God saw that it was good.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">19</span>And that morning and that evening were the fourth day.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">20</span>And God said, "Let the waters bring forth abundant life with living
                creatures that move and birds that fly in the Heavens above the Earth."
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">21</span>Then God created an abundance of great whales and every kind of
                living moving creature living in the waters, plus every type of winged bird that flew above the Earth,
                and God saw that it was good.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">22</span>Then God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the
                waters of the seas with abundant life, and let the birds multiply abundantly upon the Earth."
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">23</span>And that morning and that evening were the fifth day.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">24</span>And God said, "Let the Earth bring forth every kind of living
                creature including cattle, animals, creeping things, and every other living thing on Earth" and it was
                so.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">25</span>God created animals of every kind, including cattle, creeping
                things, and every other living thing on the Earth, and God saw that it was good.
            <p>
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">26</span>And God said, "Let's make man in our image, a man who looks like us.
                and man will preserve and control all the fish, birds, cattle, creeping things, and every other living
                thing on Earth."
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">27</span>So God created man in his image, both male and female.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">28</span>Then God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful, multiply, and
                replenish the Earth; Take control of the fish, birds, and every other living thing on Earth."
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">29</span>And God said, "Behold, I've given you every seed-bearing herb and
                fruit tree on the Earth for you to eat.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">30</span>I've given you every living thing on the Earth, including every
                beast and bird, the creeping things, green herbs for food, and every other living thing on the Earth,"
                and it was so.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">31</span>And God saw that everything that He'd created was very good, and
                that morning and that evening were the sixth day.
