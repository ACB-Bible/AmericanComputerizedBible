            <p id="id-acbTextTitle2" class="cs-acbTextTitle">Genesis 1</p>
            <p>
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">1</span> In the beginning, God created Heaven and Earth.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">2</span> The Earth was void and without form, darkness covered the face of
                the deep, and God's Spirit moved over the waters.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">3</span> And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">4</span> God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the
                darkness.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">5</span> God called the light Day and the darkness Night. That morning and
                that evening were the first day.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">6</span> And God said, "Let there be a firmament in the middle of the waters,
                and
                it'll divide the waters from the waters."
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">7</span> God made the firmament and divided the waters under the firmament
                from
                the waters above the firmament, and it was so.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">8</span> God called the firmament Heaven. That morning and that evening were
                the
                second day.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">9</span> And God said, "Let the waters under Heaven be gathered together into
                one
                place and let the dry land appear," and it was so.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">10</span> God named the dry land Earth and He called the waters the seas, and
                God saw that it was good.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">11</span> And God said, "Let the Earth bring forth every kind of grass,
                seed-bearing herb, and fruit-bearing tree, each with their seed," and it was so.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">12</span> And the Earth brought forth every kind of grass, herb, and
                fruit-bearing tree with their seed, and God saw that it was good.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">13</span> That morning and that evening were the third day.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">14</span> And God said, "Let there be lights in the Heavens to divide the day
                from the night and let them be a sign for the seasons, days, months, and years.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">15</span> Let the lights in the Heavens give light on the Earth," and it was
                so.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">16</span> God made two great lights, the Sun to rule the day, and the Moon
                and
                Stars to rule the night.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">17</span> God placed the lights in the Heavens to give light to the Earth.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">18</span> And to divide the light from the darkness and to rule over the days
                and
                nights, and God saw that it was good.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">19</span> That morning and that evening were the fourth day.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">20</span> And God said, "Let the waters bring forth abundant life with living
                creatures that move and birds that fly in the Heavens above the Earth."
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">21</span> God created an abundance of great whales and every kind of living
                moving creature that lived in the waters, plus every type of winged bird, and God saw that it was good.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">22</span> And God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the
                waters of the seas with abundant life, and let the birds multiply abundantly upon the Earth."
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">23</span> That morning and that evening were the fifth day.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">24</span> And God said, "Let the Earth bring forth every kind of living
                creature
                including every kind of cattle, every kind of animal, everything that creeps, and every other living
                thing
                on Earth" and it was so.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">25</span> God created animals of every kind. He created every kind of cattle,
                everything that creeps, and every other living thing on Earth, and God saw that it was good.
            <p>
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">26</span> And God said, "Let us make man in our image, a man who looks like
                us.
                And he'll preserve and control all the fish, birds, cattle, everything that creeps, and every other
                living
                thing on Earth."
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">27</span> So God created man in his image, both male and female.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">28</span> God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful, multiply, and replenish
                the
                Earth. Take control of the fish, birds, and every other living thing on Earth."
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">29</span> And God said, "Behold, I've given you every seed-bearing herb and
                every
                seed-bearing fruit tree on Earth for you to eat.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">30</span> I've given you every living thing on Earth, every beast, every
                bird,
                every green herb for food, everything that creeps, and every other living thing on the Earth," and it
                was so.
                <span class="cs-acbNumber">31</span> God saw that everything he'd created was very good. That morning
                and that evening were the sixth day.
