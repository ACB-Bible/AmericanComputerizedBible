            The <span class="cs-acbItalic">"American Computerized Bible"</span><span class="cs-acbTrademark">®</span> is
            only one part of the acbbible.com<span class="cs-acbTrademark">®</span> ministry, and it's a work in
            progress. It's a mission of love, and it currently contains eight different versions of the Holy Bible. The
            <span class="cs-acbItalic">"American Computerized Bible"</span><span class="cs-acbTrademark">®</span>
            website itself consists of the actual computer source code that makes the website work. This work has
            consisted of many years of researching and finding usable Bible text files that could be programmatically
            transferred into a workable database that can be read and used by the website. Most of these files were
            scavenged from various online sources, and custom computer programs have been written to transfer each one
            of them into a useable database format.<br><br>

            The <span class="cs-acbItalic">"Twenty-First Century Bible"</span><span class="cs-acbTrademark">®</span> is
            another part of this ministry ministry, and it's included in the <span class="cs-acbItalic">"American
                Computerized Bible"</span><span class="cs-acbTrademark">®</span> that I'm translating it from various
            versions of the ancient texts, including the <span class="cs-acbItalic">"King James Version"</span> which
            was first published in 1611. The <span class="cs-acbItalic">"Twenty-First Century Bible"</span><span
                class="cs-acbTrademark">®</span> is a living Biblical translation and it's inspired by the teachings of
            Jesus Christ. It's a gift from God for people of the twenty-first century and beyond to study. As of April
            26, 2023, except for editing and proof reading, translation through the book of Leviticus Chapter: 14 is
            mostly complete, that is until tomorrow. <br><br>

            <span class="cs-acbStatement">God loves you, we love you, and this is God's free gift from us to you.</span>
