            The <span class="cs-acbItalic">American Computerized Bible</span> is only one part of my ministry, and it's
            a work in progress. It's a mission of love that the Lord has laid on my heart, and it currently contains
            eight different versions of the Holy Bible. These Bibles have been compiled because Jesus said, in Mark 16:15-18<span style="color: crimson"> "Go out into
                all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. Anyone that believes and is baptized will be
                saved,
                but whoever does not believe will be condemned."</span> Many years of dedicated research have gone into
            assembling
            what I hope you will find to be a quality useful online Bible. I believe if someone even if it's only one
            person finds salvation through this effort, my mission will have been accomplished.<br><br>

            The <span class="cs-acbItalic">Twenty-First Century Bible</span>< is
            another part of this ministry, and it's included in the <span class="cs-acbItalic">American Computerized
                Bible</span>. The <span class="cs-acbItalic">Twenty-First Century Bible</span> is going to be new modern
            version of the Bible that's being translated from various versions of ancient biblical texts, including the
            <span class="cs-acbItalic">King James Version</span>
            which was first published in 1611. The <span class="cs-acbItalic">Twenty-First Century Bible</span> is a
            living Biblical translation that's inspired by the teachings of Jesus Christ. It's a gift from God for
            people of the twenty-first century and beyond to study. As of April 26, 2023, except for editing and proof
            reading, translation through the book of Leviticus Chapter: 14 is mostly complete, that is until God's spirit moves me tomorrow. And it's my mission to preach the gospel to the whole world.<br><br>
