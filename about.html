            <span class="cs-acbBold">The 'American Computerized Bible'</span> is a ministry the Holy Spirit has
            led me to, and it's a work in progress. It's actually two projects in one, the first part
            is the technological part which is the actual web page and Bible editing software that
            we're coding. It will also contain many different public domain versions of the Holy Bible,
            including The 'Twenty-First Century Bible' which is a new and improved, kinder, gentler version
            of the Holy Bible that we're translating from various ancient texts including the
            'King James Version' of the Holy Bible which was first published in 1611. The
            'Twenty-First Century Bible' is a living Biblical translation and it's inspired by the teachings
            of Jesus Christ for people in the twenty-first century and beyond to study. As of March 5, 2023,
            the 'Twenty-first Century Bible' is in the first draft stage, and except for editing and proof
            reading, translation through the book of Leviticus Chapter: 14, is mostly complete, until
            tomorrow. The 'American Computerized Bible' currently has eight public domain versions
            of the Holy Bible in the ACB-Bible database.
