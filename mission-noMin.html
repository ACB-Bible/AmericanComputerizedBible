            The <span class="cs-acbEmph">American Computerized Bible </span>is a a very small part of God's ministry, and it's a mission that He's given me to fulfill. The <span class="cs-acbEmph">Twenty-First Century Bible </span>is another part of this ministry, and it's a modern, new, twenty-first century version of the Bible that's being translated from various ancient biblical texts. I hope you find this work to be a high quality and useful online Bible for your worship services, and your Biblical studies. I hope it helps you with your mission to preach God's word to the entire world.
            <br><br>

            If anyone finds salvation through these efforts, no matter if it's one person or thousands, then I believe that I will have accomplished the mission that God has entrusted me with.
