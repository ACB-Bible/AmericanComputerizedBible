            The <span class="cs-acbItalic">American Computerized Bible </span>is a a very small part of God's ministry, and it's a mission that He's given to me to fulfill. The <span class="cs-acbItalic">Twenty-First Century Bible </span>is a new, twenty-first century, modern version of the Bible that's being translated from various other versions of the ancient biblical texts, and it's another part of this ministry. I hope you find this work to be a high quality and useful online Bible for your Biblical studies, and I hope it helps you with your mission to preach God's word to the entire world.
            <br><br>

            I believe if anyone at all anywhere finds salvation through these efforts, then the mission God has given me will have been accomplished.
