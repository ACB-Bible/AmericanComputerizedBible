### American Computerized Bible
**Revelation 21:5** *"Behold I'm making all things new again. And he said, 'Write this: These words are true and faithful.'"*

The "American Computerized Bible" is just one part of a ministry the Lord has laid on my heart and it's a work in progress, and it will contain many different public domain versions of the Bible. The "American Computerized Bible" itself consists of the computer source code that actually makes the website work. This work has consisted of many years of researching and finding usable public domain Bible text files and programmatically transferring them into a workable database that can be read and used by the website. Most text files had to have custom programs written for each one of them to get them into a useable format.

The "Twenty-First Century Bible" is another part of my ministry, its included in the "American Computerized Bible," and I'm translating it from various ancient texts, including "The King James Version" of the Bible which was first published in 1611. The "Twenty First Century Bible" is a living Biblical translation and it's inspired by the teachings of Jesus Christ, and its a gift from God for the twenty-first century people and beyond to study. As of April 25, 2023, except for editing and proof reading, translation through the book of Leviticus Chapter: 14 is mostly complete, that is until tomorrow.
