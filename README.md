### American Computerized Bible<br>
**Revelation 21:5** *"Behold I'm making all things new again. And he said, 'Write this: These words are true and faithful.'"*<br>
The "American Computerized Bible" is a ministry the Lord has laid on my heart and it's a work in
progress and will contain many different public domain versions of the Bible. The "Twenty First Century Bible"
is just one part of this ministry and I'm translating it from various ancient texts and "The King James Version"
of the Bible which was first published in 1611. The "Twenty First Century Bible" is a living Biblical translation
and it's inspired by the teachings of Jesus for people in the twenty-first century and beyond to study. As of January 4, 2023,
except for editing and proof reading, translation through the book of Leviticus Chapter: 11, is mostly complete until tomorrow.
