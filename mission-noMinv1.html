            The <span class="cs-acbItalic">American Computerized Bible</span> website is a mission of love that the Lord
            has laid on my heart, and it currently contains
            eight different versions of the Holy Bible, it's a work in progress, and it's only one part of my ministry.
            These Bible versions have been assembled because Jesus said, in Mark 16:15-18<span style="color: crimson">
                "Go out into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. Anyone that believes and is
                baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned."</span> Many years of dedicated
            research have gone into assembling what I hope you will find to be a high quality and useful online Bible. I
            believe if someone out there, even if it's only one person finds salvation through this effort, my mission
            will have been accomplished.<br><br>

            The <span class="cs-acbItalic">Twenty-First Century Bible</span> is the second part of this ministry, and
            it's included as part of the <span class="cs-acbItalic">American Computerized Bible</span> website. The
            <span class="cs-acbItalic">Twenty-First Century Bible</span> is going to be modern, new, tewnty-first
            century version of the Bible that's being translated from various versions of ancient biblical texts,
            including the <span class="cs-acbItalic">King James Version</span> which was first published in 1611. The
            <span class="cs-acbItalic">Twenty-First Century Bible</span> is a living Biblical translation that's
            inspired by the teachings of Jesus Christ. It's a gift from God for people of the twenty-first century and
            beyond to study. As of May 6, 2023, except for editing and proof reading, translation through the book of
            Leviticus Chapter 14 is mostly complete, that is until God's spirit moves me tomorrow. And it's my mission
            from God to preach the gospel to the whole world.<br><br>
