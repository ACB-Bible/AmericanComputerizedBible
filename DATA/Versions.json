        "ab": "Revelation 21:5 Behold I'm making all things new again. And He said, 'Write this: These words are true and faithful.' The Twenty-First Century Bible was begun in 2019, it's a ministry and a work in process that the Lord has blessed me with and laid on my heart. It's being translated from various ancient texts, including \"The King James Version\" of the Bible which was first published in 1611. It's a living translation inspired by the teachings of our savior Jesus Christ for the people in the twenty-first century and beyond. As of February 9, 2023, the outline and rough draft of this translation is mostly complete through the book of Leviticus Chapter: 11. I believe that God through the Holy Spirit has given me these words, and they're not meant to force any kind of religion on you, question your faith, or belittle your relationship with God. These words were given to me to spread the word of love and joy that Jesus Christ offers us. It's my hope that you'll find these words to be inspirational, and that they reinforce your faith in His Son, our savior Jesus Christ...Gregg Butler",

It was commissioned by England's King James VI and I in 1604, and it was completed and published in 1611. The books of the 'King James Version(KJV)' include 39 books of the Old Testament, 27 books of the New Testament, and an intertestamental section that contains 14 books of the Apocrypha. This translation is noted for its 'majesty of style,' and has been described as one of the most important books in English culture and a driving force in shaping the English-speaking world. In my researching the Bible for the 'American Computerized Bible,' I have discovered in my research that there were various attempts to translate the Bible into English since the seventh century. Unless more records are discovered in the future, I have determined that theere were at least six prominent versions of the Bible that were translated before the 'King James Version(KJV)' of the Bible, including the 'Old English Bible(OEB),' circa. pre-1066, the 'Middle English Bible(MEB),' circa. 1066-1500, 'Wycliffe's Bible(WYC)' c.1382-1395, the 'Early Modern English Bible(EMEB),' 'Tyndale Bible(TYN)' c.1526-1535, 'The Great Bible(TGB),' circa. 1539, 'Douay-Rheims Bible(D-R)(DRB)(DRV)', (DRB)New Testament circa. 1582, (DRB)Old Testament circa. 1609-1610.",

For example: 'why' instead of 'wherefore', 'its' instead of 'his' when referring to nonliving things, 'male child' instead of 'manchild', etc. He also introduced euphemisms to remove words he found offensive: 'whore' becomes 'lewd woman' and changed some of the spelling of the 1611 version, some of which had been changed by British usage since 1611 and others that he himself had deliberately changed in his dictionary to reflect an American identity over a British one. Overall, very few changes were made, and the result is a book which is almost indistinguishable from the King James Version. It has sometimes been called the 'Common Version' (which is not to be confused with the Common Bible of 1973, an ecumenical edition of the Revised Standard Version)",
